# Zet CLI
A Zettlekasten helper utility.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mattdood/zet-cli.git zet-cli
```
1. Install the cloned repository via pip from the cloned folder
```
cd path/to/install
python3 -m pip install -e zet-cli
```

## Usage
The commands are well documented using `--help`.

There are a large number of default settings. Part of the TODO is to migrate these
to the `.env/.local.json` file in the install location to keep things tidier.
